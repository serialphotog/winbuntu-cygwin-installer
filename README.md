# Winbuntu minimal Cygwin installer

This is the source for the Winbuntu Cygwin installer. This simply downloads the minimum Cygwin requirements needed to run an Xserver. This project won't make much sense on its own, so you should check out the [Winbuntu](https://github.com/serialphotog/winbuntu) project.

This project is originally based on the [Cygwin installer](https://github.com/starlight/lux-minimal) for the awesome [Starlight](http://www.starlig.ht/) project.
